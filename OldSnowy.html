<p><b>Old Snowy – September 22, 2005 (and a revisit on August 12, 2006)</b></p>

<p>The Goat Rock Wilderness has a big reputation for rugged scenic beauty in
the shadow of Mt Rainier.&nbsp; And the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) winds right
through it.&nbsp; It’s also highest point of the entire length of the
PCT.&nbsp; It’s a long drive from my home so my visit would have to fit my
email in sick/sleep in the car/hike the next day protocol.&nbsp; I set up my
new computer program that would automatically email my call-in-sick email at
6:45am the next day and then I left home at 8pm.&nbsp; I arrived for bed by
11pm.&nbsp; I was up and fed by 4am to start my hike – destination: <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Old</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Snowy</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mountain</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> in Goat Rocks.</p>

<p>I started my hike under very bright half moon light.&nbsp; The tree shadows
were so dark that I still had to use my headlight.&nbsp; Within 10 minutes of
starting I noticed two brown disks glowing about 20 ft ahead on the
trail.&nbsp; I thought it might be an owl because I didn’t hear any
noise.&nbsp; I took a few steps and started to get concerned that these disks
were way too far apart to be an owl.&nbsp; Now I had a problem: Was I looking
at some sort of trail marker or a very large animal?&nbsp; I stood there a
minute and made a loud grunt to get some sort of reaction from the unknown
thing.&nbsp; The grunt spooked a very large elk and it took off running.&nbsp;
Being chocolate brown and in the night shadows, he was invisible to me until he
ran on.&nbsp; He was big: his shoulders at my eye level.&nbsp; He must have
been under the spell of my headlight.&nbsp; Onward.</p>

<p>Progress was good.&nbsp; I made it Snowgrass Flats (next picture) well
before sunrise.&nbsp; There was a thin cloud cover that drew out and muted the
sunrise.&nbsp; Here’s my first look at my destination: Old Snowy is the
left-most mountain on the ridge.&nbsp; To the right is <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Ives</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Peak</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
and then Mt Curtis-Gilbert.&nbsp; The junction with the PCT is nearby ahead.</p>

<p><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1025" src=HikePics/OSSnowgrassFlats.jpg
border=0></p>

<p>Hiking over Snowgrass Flats was a lot of fun.&nbsp; There were lots of ups
and downs with mini cliffs all around.&nbsp; It was easy to see from the top of
Old Snowy later that the area was carved out by glaciers not too long
ago.&nbsp; In every area there was either a glacial deposit or gouge.&nbsp;
Here’s a closer look at Old Snowy below.&nbsp; The PCT climbs over the ridge
that goes off the picture to the left.&nbsp; My route is along the ridgeline
from the PCT to the peak on the right.</p>

<p><img width=641 height=480 id="_x0000_i1026" src=HikePics/OSGoingUp.jpg border=0></p>

<p>Here’s my first view of Mt Rainier upon reaching the ridge crest at 7000 ft
by following the PCT.&nbsp; The sun still hadn’t touched me.&nbsp; I think Mt
Rainier is a very handsome mountain!</p>

<p><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1027" src=HikePics/OSMtRanier.jpg border=0></p>

<p>As soon as I got to Snowgrass Flats, I noticed a pair of hikers coming my
way fast in the distance along the PCT.&nbsp; They finally caught up with me at
the ridge crest.&nbsp; The conversation went something like this:</p>

<p>How ya doin?</p>

<p><i>Great!&nbsp; Nice day for a hike, not too hot.</i></p>

<p>Where ya comin’ from?</p>

<p><i>I don’t know the name.&nbsp; We camped somewhere down there.</i></p>

<p>Are you hiking the PCT?</p>

<p><i>Yep.</i></p>

<p>Where’d you start?</p>

<p><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><i>Mexico</i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i>.</i></p>

<p>Wow!&nbsp; How long ya been hiking?</p>

<p><i>Five months.</i></p>

<p>How much longer will you hike?</p>

<p><i>About two more weeks.</i></p>

<p>Well I hope you don’t get too much snow.&nbsp; It’s late.</p>

<p><i>We already got snow.&nbsp; Wasn’t pretty.</i>&nbsp; (All they had were
sneakers)</p>

<p>Ok. Enjoy your trip and congratulations.&nbsp; Oh, turn around and smile.
&nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p><img width=480 height=640 id="_x0000_i1028" src=HikePics/OSPCTHikers.jpg border=0></p>

<p>Here’s <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Goat</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> at 6000 ft - a giant hole that
fills with snow melt at the end of Goat Ridge.</p>

<p><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1029" src=HikePics/OSGoatLake.jpg border=0></p>

<p>Here’s my last steep pitch to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">peak</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Old Snowy</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.
&nbsp;That’s Mt Adams in the distance.</p>

<p><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1030" src=HikePics/OSIvesAdams.jpg border=0></p>

<p>From the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">peak</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Old Snowy</st1:PlaceName> and along the ridge is <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Ives</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Peak</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
on the right and Mt Curtis-Gilbert on the left. &nbsp;The snow is various
glaciers on the north side.</p>

<p><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1031" src=HikePics/OSCurtisGilbertIves.jpg
border=0></p>

<p>On the way down, I took a shortcut through a glacier deposition zone and
came across some hiker whimsy: a mini <st1:place w:st="on">Stonehenge</st1:place>.&nbsp;
Somebody must have spent a lot of time looking for just the right sized
rectangular rocks.</p>

<p><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1032" src=HikePics/OSStoneHenge.jpg border=0></p>

<p>&nbsp;It was a long hike, about 14 miles.&nbsp; Aside from the PCT
backpackers I only saw two other backpackers.&nbsp; I didn’t see the area’s
namesake wildlife: mountain goats.&nbsp; I’ve heard they are around there but
obviously not today.</p>

<p>I got home and realized why my pictures were so grainy.&nbsp; I must have
fiddled with the ISO number for night time pictures weeks ago and never set it
back.&nbsp; I’m sorry the pictures couldn’t be as crisp as they should be. And
that automatic sick email program I tested several times and started the day
before didn’t work the one time I needed it to.&nbsp; I had some ‘splainin to
do the next day.</p>

<p>And last but not least, for proof that the view from the top is great, look
at this <a href="HikePics/panorama.jpg">360 degree
panorama image</a> from the top of Old Snowy.&nbsp; Hint: Resize it in your

<p>REVISIT:</p>

<p>I returned to this most beautiful place on August 12, 2006, very early on a
Saturday.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wanted to explore the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Goat</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
area and look for the elusive goats.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
hiked to the top of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Hawkes</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Peak</st1:PlaceType> overlooking <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Goat</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
(it’s the highest point on the cirque surrounding the lake in the picture
above).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Goat Ridge trail is a direct
route to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Goat</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and much more scenic than the trail
I took last year.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p>When I finally arrived at the peak, I discovered the goats like to hang out
near the ridge tops of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Lilly</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Basin</st1:PlaceType>, a little visited glacial valley on “the other
side” of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Goat</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The ridge to <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Hawkes</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Peak</st1:PlaceType> separates the two valleys and most people stay
on the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Goat</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> side.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I got to the top and planted myself for a
long look for goats.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After some
searching I caught a peek through the cracks of a crag of a trio of goats about
a hundred feet from my perch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
hadn’t seen me yet so I crept over to get a closer look.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that point my profile was in their view.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They carefully and purposefully jogged
away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It wasn’t a trot across a flat
meadow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They scampered over steep
slippery rock slopes and even over what looked like cliff from my vantage point
above.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They finally joined a herd of 20
or so across the basin where they laid down and sunned themselves in safety.</p>

<p>The goat show ended and I headed down to see <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Goat</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lake was 50% filled with snow. The
surrounding slopes were covered in wildflowers thriving from the constant feed
of snow melt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This might be where the
Garden of Eden was located.</p>

<p>My hike out was fun but I constantly encountered the weekend hordes of
campers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The visitation season is short
in Goats Rocks (July through September) and after that, the area is locked in
snow.</p>

<p>I’m sorry I can’t show pictures.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
camera was on vacation on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Pennsylvania</st1:State></st1:place>.</p>
