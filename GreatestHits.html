<B><P>My Favorite Outdoors Pictures - Various Dates</P>
</B><P>This is collection of scans from pictures from outdoors adventures I've had since moving to the Northwest. I took all the pictures on this page except where noted. Since Nick was born, I've stopped carrying a camera. Hopefully our yet-to-purchase digital camera will change that.</P>
<B><P>Badlands, SD:</B> Nancy and I were driving west across the country in early June of 1994 during the peak of spring. We just spent the night in Mitchell, SD and after heading out, we passed the Badlands. You just don't drive past the Badlands without stopping. This landscape is usually dry and brown but in June it's spring green.</P>

<B><P>Catherine Creek, Columbia River Gorge near Lyle, WA:</B> Catherine Creek is an old homesteaders valley in a beautiful section of the eastern Gorge. It was recently saved from development and protected with a park area. Springtime is a great time to visit due to the wet weather.</P>
<P>Looking west down the Columbia River:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/CatherineCreek1.jpg" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=318></P>
<P>Looking at the old corral from the homesteader's kitchen window. Nancy took this picture:</P>

<B><P>Latourell Falls, Columbia River Gorge near Cascade Locks, OR:</B> The Oregon side of the Gorge overflows with waterfall hikes. It's not hard to get a picture like this one.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/LatourellFalls.jpg" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=480></P>
<B><P>Dog Mtn, Columbia River Gorge near White Salmon, WA:</B> I'm not sure why they call it Dog Mountain but the steepness of the hike might give a good clue. It's a wildflower bonanza hike. This is a view of Oregon from Dog Mountain.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/DogMtn.jpg" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=310></P>
<B><P>Cooper Spur, Mt Hood, OR:</B> Cooper Spur is the backbone of Mt Hood on the northeast side. It's a popular approach for the some of difficult climbing routes to the top. This picture shows an area called "Tie-in rock" where summiteers gear up for the technical part of the climb. You feel like you're on top of the world up there.</P>
<P>Some hikers on the last flat part 'til the top:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/CooperSpur1.jpg" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=269></P>
<P>We were just hiking along and I looked up. I saw this beautiful bare tree shining against the crystal clear high altitude sky:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/CooperSpur2.jpg" WIDTH=342 HEIGHT=480></P>
<B><P>Crater Lake National Park, OR:</B> One fine October weekend, Nancy and I decided to take a road trip to Crater Lake. This is a must see for anyone who visits Oregon. It was very low season tourist-wise and we were treated to cold weather and new snow.</P>
<P>Here's Wizard Island:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/CraterLake1.jpg" WIDTH=353 HEIGHT=480></P>
<P>Here's Mt Scott in the distance. The "ship" is the rock in the water:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/CraterLake2.jpg" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=289></P>
<B><P>Wind Mtn, near Stevenson, WA:</B> One of my favorite short Gorge hikes is Wind Mountain. It's a good step sprint with great views and very little traffic. It's a great place to see a sunset too.</P>
<P>What I like about wildflowers is that all my favorites have names that perfectly describe them. This is a pair of Fairy Slippers:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/FairySlippers.jpg" WIDTH=377 HEIGHT=480></P>
<B><P>Close Encounters on Mt Hood, OR:</B> Mt Hood is the closest big mountain to Portland so naturally I visit it when I'm too lazy to drive far for a hike. These pictures document various unique experiences I've had there.</P>
<P>I took this picture on a late afternoon setup:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/FlowersFromMtHood.jpg" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=332></P>
<P>Here's a view of Mt Adams from near McNeil Point:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MtAdamsFromMtHood.jpg" WIDTH=368 HEIGHT=480></P>
<P>I met a couple who were out giving their llamas some exercise. They had two of these gentle creatures with them. If they were any smaller, they'd make the perfect house pet:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MtHoodLlama.jpg" WIDTH=359 HEIGHT=480></P>
<P>I met the llama party on my way up to McNeil Point. On my way down about an hour before sunset, I met a friendly older gentleman who was limping along with a broomstick for a crutch. He talked my ear off 'til it was nearly dark. He told me he had a car accident as a teenager and he has used a broomstick all his life as a crutch. He was a nice guy and not bitter in any way. After we parted, he continued up. I got back to my car in darkness. Sometimes I wonder if he was really a mountain spirit.</P>
<B><P>Glacier National Park, MT:</B> On a late September, Jeff, Todd, and I started a 5 day backpacking trip through Glacier National Park in Montana. Winter waits for no man in Glacier. We got lucky and found cold weather and some snow but great backpacking conditions nonetheless. This place is a gem. Either Jeff or Todd took these pictures at Glacier.</P>
<P>At the terminus of our hike in, we took a round trip day hike to a mountain pass. The trail took us past a series of 3 or 4 hanging valleys each with a grand stairstep waterfall. On this hike we saw a moose and a black bear:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/GlacierNP.jpg" WIDTH=324 HEIGHT=480></P>
<P>Speaking of bears, you have to learn the fine art of grizzly bear avoidance before you get your backpacking permit. After not so much as a clue of a grizzly, we found a set of tracks of a grizzly that was using our trail. It was a nice reminder to heed our bear lesson. Note the horseshoe prints for scale. It wasn't the grand-daddy grizzly but it was big enough to do serious damage:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/Grizzly.jpg" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=337></P>
<B><P>Ramona Falls, Mt Hood, OR:</B> Ramona Falls is probably the most visited place on Mt Hood. Visit in late autumn before the roads close for the best experience. Here's a picture during a visit Nancy and I made on a very rainy day in November.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/RamonaFalls.jpg" WIDTH=358 HEIGHT=480></P>
<B><P>Tillamook Light, near Tillamook, OR:</B> Sometimes you just can't leave a good photo-op. Here's one of the Tillamook Lighthouse.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/TillamookLight.jpg" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=311></P>
<B><P>Mt St Helens, WA:</B> When I lived in Vancouver, I could leave my house and be on the trail to top of Mt St Helens in one hour. Naturally I would visit often. Here's a mid-November hike to the top on a perfect hike day.</P>
<P>Here's a view of the peak from across the crater:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MtStHelens1.jpg" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=316></P>
<P>Here's Mt Adams to the east. The color was not adjusted in this picture. The sky really was that dark:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MtStHelens2.jpg" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=308></P>
<B><P>Vancouver, WA:</B> Our house in Vancouver was often graced with sunrises like this one right from the kitchen window.</P>
