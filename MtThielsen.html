<B><P>Mt Thielsen - September 22, 2003</P>
</B>
<P>A long time ago, Nancy and I visited Crater Lake on a beautiful clear and cold October weekend.  While we spent most of our time at the park at Crater Lake, I found myself constantly wondering what that pointy towering mountain was in the distance.  I got my answer from the local friendlies.  It was Mt Thielsen. Nobody told me it was hikable and I assumed it wasn't.  I figured nobody could climb such a vertical feature.  The October snow made it look forbidding.  Since then I learned that Mt Thielsen is indeed hikable and that it is a relatively short non-technical climb.  Any hike report I've read does come with the appropriate warnings: persons with vertigo or lacking the will and confidence to scale a rock wall like a spider should probably not attempt the peak.  The warnings convinced me that I should go.  Planning started in 2002.</P>

<P>As usual, my big fall hike starts with an official "sick day" email followed by a long drive in the dark.  I took the scenic route but all I saw was trees. There was no moon.  I finally got to the trailhead at 11pm where I spread out my sleeping bag in my mini-RV Jetta.  I got a good night sleep and started hiking at 6:30am at about 5400 feet.  The first 4 miles belie the excitement of the last mile of the ascent.  It was a gradually sloping walk through the woods with occasional views of Diamond Lake and Mt Bailey.  At the 4 mile mark, I crossed Pacific Crest Trail at 7276 feet and then the fun began.  Around this point, I got my first glimpse of the Lady at 8am.  Like you, reader, I was wondering how one actually gets to the tippy-top.</P>

<P>After the PCT junction, the trail was dusty with a good helping of chipped rock talus everywhere.  It steepened with every step.  Here's a view looking down from the trail above treeline.  Note Mt Thielsen's pointy shadow.  That's Diamond Lake and Mt Bailey in the background.</P>

<P>The trail was steep enough that you had to use your hands to maneuver so I couldn't carry my camera in my hand.  Constantly pulling out the camera then stashing it slowed me down but it allowed Neil time to catch me.  We talked a bit.  Neil is from Portland and on vacation.  His wife dropped him off for the day because "She doesn't like this kind of hiking".  That sounds familiar.  Neil just turned 50 and said he hiked today to "Make sure my legs could still do it". After talking he kept on going.  Soon I learned that our climb paces matched up pretty well so we just hiked together.  He climbed Thielsen a couple of years ago so I figured it might be a good idea to watch and learn so I don't pick the "wrong" route (in other words, a fatal route).  His presence in the pictures helps convey the scale.</P>

<P>Here's the steep rocky part of the climb, about an hour to the top.</P>

<P>Steeper yet.  Note that my camera was tilted a little.</P>

<P>Even more steeper but, fortunately, the slippery rock ended and it was pretty good footing all the way to the top.</P>

<P>Finally we got to the dangerous part.  We hauled up what looked like a rain gully to the bottom of the 80 foot spire.  Luckily for both of us we were equally cautious so we spent a good 15 minutes discussing how to scale the wall.  It became obvious why this wasn't a technical climb.  A fall wouldn't result in a 1000 foot free fall but rather a pretty fast tumble to some very solid rocks at the foot of the spire.  It was best to be careful and take our time anyway. Here's Neil pointing out what he thinks is the best way up.</P>

<P>This is the bottom part of the spire.  You grab what you can and place your feet in whatever you can find.  The wall was firm and we experienced very little movement.  Climbing down was much harder than going up because finding a good foot-hold while hugging the rock was all guesswork.</P>

<P>Here's Neil on top looking at Diamond Lake at 9182 feet.  Note his cautious lean to his left.  It's a long fall in any direction.  There was just enough breeze to make it comfortable.</P>

<P>I layed belly down on a big flat rock at the top and looked straight down. This is what I saw.  It's a straight 2000 foot drop to the rocks below.</P>

<P>Here's a view from the top along the south ridge.</P>

<P>During my hike down I took a bunch of pictures.   There were many mini-Thielsens all over the place near the top.</P>

<P>I got back to the tree line and I was tired but I had to do my best freight train to get back to the car quickly.  I had to be home by dinner.  I got to the PCT at 1pm and it was hot.  I normally plan well for weather but it slipped my mind that it might actually be hot and not cold.  I ran out of water and had no shorts.  I was parched by the time my adventure was over at 2pm.  I took a short rest at a park on Diamond Lake where I was the only person in the park.  I took this picture to sum up my day.</P>

<P>These pictures were taken with our tiny Canon S230 digital camera.  It's a technical marvel!  It'll hold some 300+ high-res pictures.  It'll even do digital movies with sound.</P>
