<B><P>Elowah Falls - December 1998</P>
</B><P>The Oregon side of the Columbia River Gorge has many short waterfall hikes. Those dry and cold east wind days can sometimes present a hiking experience that few seem willing to enjoy - the falls aren't so fluid due to the cold. The month of December 1998 started out with long extended dry and cold weather and stayed that way until right before Christmas. Nick was due to be born at the end of the month and I was shackled at home playing the waiting game. Around December 15 I couldn't take the confinement any longer and decided to visit Elowah Falls on a particularly cold Saturday morning. </P>
<P>It was probably about 15 degrees when I left the house at 7am. I arrived at the falls by 8am and, after a short 1.5 mile hike in, I arrived at the foot of the falls where I would estimate the temperature to be around 5 degrees. At this time of year the sun never reaches the falls. This weather had persisted for at least a week prior so the possibility for heavy ice was pretty good. The pictures below tell the story of what I found. The ice was extremely localized. The flow was small by Gorge standards.</P>
<P>Here's the 289ft waterfall part of Elowah Falls. The water came over the cliff and, by the time it hit bottom, it was ice. It didn't sound like a waterfall on this morning: it sounded like a heavy whisper. At the bottom was no pool of water. It was a pile of ice crystals. </P>

<P>Here's a closer look at the pile of ice. Note the ice covered run out area downstream. This is where the remaining pictures were shot.</P>

<P>Here's the ice pile even closer.</P>

<P>Here's a look at the small hoodoos of ice that caked every vertical blade of grass. This is looking back at the trail which ends at the falls. The ice zone ended literally right in the picture.</P>

<P>The next several pictures focused on ice details that I found interesting.</P>

<P>I took the next two pictures for the texture that the ice was forming for the camera. Both of these would make nice "wallpaper" for your computer!</P>

<P>Two weeks later, Nick was born on Christmas. It was pouring rain that day (I think). It was the last time I would carry a camera for a few years. Nick would take up the camera carrying space.</P>
