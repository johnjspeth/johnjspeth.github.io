<B><P>Mt Adams Climb - September 6, 2001</P>
</B><P>The night before, I emailed my medicinal holiday plans to my work colleagues. I was free for one day.</P>
<P>I used the non-technical South Climb route starting at the Cold Springs campground. I awoke at 4am on a clear, cold, and windless moonlit morning. I was on the trail by 5am (5600ft). No headlamp needed due to the bright moon. Sun started to light the peak by 6am. By then I was 2-3 miles into the hike making great time. I got to the top of the Crescent Glacier (around 9000ft) by 8:30am thinking "Great progress, I'll be at the top by 11am". At 10,000ft at 9:30am I met Paul and his partner who gave me a more realistic climbing rate. Paul said if he could make 600 vertical feet per hour, he's doing good. I accepted that as a good measure of the progress I could expect for myself. My readjusted summit time was now 12:30pm. Sure enough I got to the top at 1pm after a long lunch at Pikers Peak.</P>
<P>The peak was veiled in a thin cloud cap that killed all views. I got a glimpse of Mt Rainier to the north just as I arrived at the top. It was my last view of anything. Luckily there was a guy who hiked up from Killen Creek on the north side who told me the story of the sulfur mine and shack at the top. Believe it or not, horse teams were used to haul sulfur from the mine for a time in the 1930's. That would explain the broken and twisted power wires I encountered most of the way up. I guess sulfur has fetching pretty good prices back then!</P>
<P>Shortly after my history lesson, Paul and his nameless buddy arrived. Paul pulled out a digital camera and he asked if I would take his picture. "Of course" I said and "Hey, would you take <B>my</B> picture too and email it to me?" He said yep and that's how I got these great pictures. I gotta get one - the results are great!</P>
<P>&nbsp;Here's me standing on the shack at the top (12,275ft). Note my lean into the wind to keep from getting blown over.</P>

<P>Here's the cloud cap that we summiteers hiked into. This was taken from Pikers Peak (around 11,500ft). I presume Paul took this picture after leaving the summit shortly after me.</P>

<P>Here's a typical scene for most of the hike - lotsa rocks. That's Paul's partner. It's about 9000ft here.</P>

<P>Here's Mt Adams from about tree line (about 7000ft).</P>

<P>Here's Mt Adams from the Round-the-Mountain trail junction (about 6000ft).</P>

<P>For me, it was 8hrs up and 4hrs down. I would estimate the round trip distance to be around 10 miles. I owe my success to Nick, my 30lb trainer. The latter half of the summer was spent making sprinting hikes in the mountains (4-6mi) with him on my back every weekend. He's easy to please but demanding if we're not always moving. At least he lets me stop for water and food.</P>
<P>I don't think I'll join the yearly "parade" up Mt Hood. It's kinda funny how people line up to climb it in the spring - not exactly a wilderness experience. Besides, it's a technical climb for which I'm not trained. Climbing Mt St Helens is a hoot on the off season - late September and October is best. I'll have to check with the "boss".</P>
