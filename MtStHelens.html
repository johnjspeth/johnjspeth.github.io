<B><P>Mt St Helens Climb - November 4, 2002</P>
</B><P>It was a dry autumn. By Halloween, the perma-rain hadn't started yet. Several days after Halloween, still no rain. The Gods didn't have to send any more signals - By Sunday, I got the point. Rain was expected Tuesday so Monday was <I>my</I> day to go up Mt St Helens.</P>
<P>I awoke at 2am, ate breakfast, packed up and was out the door by 3:30. I arrived at the parking lot at 5am to find it empty! This was a tremendous sign that the Gods were still on my side. I stuffed my pack and was on the trail by 5:30am with just a hint of light to the east in dry, crisp, cold darkness.</P>
<P>The trail to the treeline was immaculate. They must have done some recent trail work but it was too dark to say for sure. Right before I arrived at the steep part at 4800ft, I caught a great view of the horizon at that magic time when the morning light is warm and colorful. Here's Mt Adams in the distance at first light.</P>

<P>After some rock scrambling, I could see the valleys in the distance filling with morning fog. Here's Mt Hood in the distance with a sea of Columbia River valley clouds in front.</P>

<P>Now that I had my sunrise pictures out of the way, the next three hours was all work - rock jumping and ash trudging. Here's the trail with the peak always visible. Mt St Helens rarely hides her peak from hikers.</P>

<P>It was cold and windy all the way up. So windy, in fact, that brown dust clouds would occasionally whisk by overhead.</P>
<P>By 10am I made it to the crater rim and it was cold with the slightest breeze. There was not a soul to be seen at the top or even on the trail below. This was a rare experience and always my hope whenever I hike. Another surprise I had was the total lack of snow, which is even rarer.</P>
<P>The arrival at the top (8365ft) is always greeted by the constant rumble of rockfall. After soaking up the view and the sounds for a while, I started to use up my film. Here's what I captured...</P>
<P>Here's Mt Adams in the distance and clouds swirling beyond the peak to the east.</P>

<P>The east cliffs of the crater are quite colorful when the sun lights them up. I was out of film by the time that happened.</P>

<P>Here's Spirit Lake filled with logs and a good view of the blast zone.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MtStHelensCrater6.jpg" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=317></P>
<P>Here's the slowly growing crater dome (lower left) with Mt Rainier in the distance to the north. Mt Rainier is expected to be the next big blast. Note her shape and the way she bulges. She even <I>looks</I> like she wants to blow.</P>

<P>Finally, I took this next picture as the sun was starting to light up the east wall. It was my last shot! The picture doesn't do it justice but that white ridge to the left of the shadow was started out in a pastel green with a silvery sheen. It was changing colors by the second. In 20 minutes, it slowly changed through many indescribable shades of green and finally ended up looking silvery grey. Autumn sunshine surely does nice things with light!</P>

<P>Soon after two hours on top, I ran out of film, food, and water and noticed somebody on the trail below. It was time to leave. I did the standard rock hop all the way down and arrived home by 4pm. This was a 12.5 hours I'll never regret and hope to repeat many times.</P>
