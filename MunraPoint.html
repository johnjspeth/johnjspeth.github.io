<B><P>Munra Point in the Columbia River Gorge, Oregon - June 2003</P>
</B><P>We just got back from a long weekend in pleasant Camp Sherman on the dry side of the Cascades. Nick has developed a slight distaste for our hikes because he's bored by the long drives and monotonous rides on Dad's back. So I didn't get my daily hikes like I wanted to. I did however discover a neat summer solstice activity: sunset hiking. I made two hikes up Black Butte in the setting sun. It's amazing how much light the sun gives at 10pm in late June. But that's another story.</P>
<P>After the weekend, we got home around noon and I was itching to burn off some energy so I was cut loose for a few hours. It was cloudy and cool and it looked like the perfect opportunity to try Munra Point in the Gorge. It's a short but sweet vertical scramble. It's only 45 minutes from home and about a mile up. Like most Gorge hikes, it starts very close to the roar of I-84. This trail was one of the noisiest but it ascends so quickly it wasn't so bad.</P>
<P>About half way up, the expansive Gorge views started to open up.</P>

<P>The Gorge is always full of surprises if you look for them. Under a nice shady oak tree I found a patch of wild lillies. My little camera wonderfully reproduced what I found. These lillies are ripe as ripe can be.</P>

<P>Here's the "top" in the upper left. It's probably best to turn back if it's too windy or raining. Fortunately it was neither. So I made my way up.</P>

<P>To my right was the start of the ridgeline that carries the trail into the mountains.</P>

<P>Here's a picture of where I was standing when I took the previous two pictures. It was a little tricky to shoot pictures and mind my feet. There wasn't much to slow me down in case of a misstep.  That's the Columbia River down there.</P>

<P>The top was fun for a few minutes but the ridgeline seemed like it needed exploring. The next four pictures show my knife-edge walk for a short distance.</P>

<P>I stopped here to turn around. It was tough to say no to the little voice in my head telling me to "go just a little bit more". I had to go home.</P>

<P>Munra Point is a great hike and I can't wait to return to hike out to as far as I can. I've read there's a large waterfall back there somewhere. I caught a glimpse of it from the Point.</P></BODY>
