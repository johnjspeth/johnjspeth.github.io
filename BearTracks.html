<p><b>Bear Tracks in the Snow on Lambertson Butte near Mt Hood – October 30,
2005</b></p>

<p>It looked like winter was on an early arrival schedule this year so I
figured I should get a final low-snow run up a place on Mt Hood I’ve never been
before.  I picked the cliffy Lambertson Butte area.  I figured there’d be a
little snow but nothing I needed to be super prepared for.  I was more worried
about the rain that they forecast for the day.  Near my destination, the butte
peak, I was annoyed to see tracks wandering around in the four new inches of
snow.  I thought I was the only one up there so early in the morning.  I got a
closer look and could see they were bear tracks.  Bear signs are rare on Mt
Hood (at least for my untrained eye) so this was a real treat.  I figured the
tracks were at most a few hours old because the snowfall had stopped sometime
in the night.</p>

<p>It was 9am and low-light snow pictures are hard to get.  Here’s a good bear
print: slightly smaller than my size 8 boot.  He must be a size 7 bear.</p>

<p>Here’s a better picture for scale.</p>

<p>In the shallow snow under the trees, I found some nice tracks that showed
toenails.  They looked sharp and long.  Prior to finding those tracks I thought
I might even have some luck seeing the bear.  In fact, the area I was in was
cliffs on two sides and his tracks were headed straight for the intersection of
both cliffs.  The toenails reminded me that I should let the bear be so I
dropped my fantasy, made some noise to announce my arrival, and continued to
the peak.</p>

<p>On my return I never saw any new tracks.  Bear was probably long gone even
before I saw his tracks.</p>
