<B><P>Middle Sister- September 28, 2004</P>
</B><P>Two years ago I made a most excellent hike up South Sister in the Three Sisters Wilderness of central Oregon. From the top of South Sister, you can almost touch the top of Middle Sister (elevation about 10,000 ft) to the north. I tagged it as a future target. The trip described here turned out to be a marathon 16 mile round trip adventure with a 5200 ft vertical ascent.</P>
<P>I emailed in sick and made the 3 hour drive the night before. The last 20 miles was on the narrow and windy Mackenzie pass highway under a full moon. I bed down in my comfy blue Jetta RV at 10 pm under a very bright full moon. I woke up at 2:30 am, ate my oatmeal and oranges and packed up. I was on the trail by 3:40 am. The first 4 miles were basically dark, flat, viewless miles. Finally around 5:30 am I reached an opening with a clear view of moonlit Middle Sister. Here's a shot of my travelling companion that morning:</P>

<P>A couple of miles later and a little before sunrise, I see the work in store for me: several hours of boulder hopping. That's North Sister in the background.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS02NorthSisterEarly.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>Another couple of hours or boulder hopping and I figure it's time for my 7am lunch. As I eat, my view of Middle Sister peak started to get illuminated by the morning sun. It looked so close from there.</P>

<P>Some careful study of my map told me a large number of nearby mountains have family names. Here’s The Husband in the distance to the right:</P>

<P>Better and longer views opened up the higher I went. Here's Three Fingered Jack (left) and Mt Jefferson (right). Mt Hood is barely visible on the far right.</P>

<P>There was a great volcano feature that looked like it could be an adventure packed trip some day: Collier Cone. From where I was, it appeared to be a vegetation free volcano crater made up of red and gray ash. There's a trail that runs the entire crater rim.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS06CollierCone.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>Finally I got out of the ash, rocks, and boulders and I was ready for snow travel. I prefer snow travel to earth travel. There's a constant supply of sippin' water and it's cooler especially when there's a breeze. Here's the bottom of my first snow field crossing (the map says glacier) with my destination at the top right. Somehow, now, it doesn't look any closer.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS07Glacier1.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>Another glacier at the North/Middle Sister saddle (or col in mountain lingo). That's the north ridge of North Sister on the left.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS08Glacier2.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>Luckily, my difficulties finding the best route up ended when I got to the snow. A path was all laid out for me now.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS09Glacier3.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=400></P>
<P>Middle and North Sisters are actually small peaks sitting on a large single foundation. The ridge between the two bottoms out at about 9000 ft. Here's a view of my final ascent to the top from the common ridge. Route picking was going to be a chore and hopefully not a lot of trial and error.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS10FinalAscent.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>My route picking was excellent. Not even one slip or backtrack. Just 50 more steps to go. That's South Sister in the distance. Note that tiny cloud at the top. It's the seed for a huge thundercloud system that developed over the remainder of the day.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS11FewMoreSteps.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>At the top, I can count the Cascade peaks looking north. That's North Sister in the short distance.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS12NorthSisterTop.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>And to prove I was there…</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS13JohnAtTop.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=400></P>
<P>There was stellar view to the south too but only visible from the top. From left to right, there's Broken Top, another mountain I don't know the name of, Bachelor Butte, and South Sister. Note the clouds slowly growing above each peak. Every peak had its own personal cloud now. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS14ViewTop2.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>Middle Sister's cloud was getting big and it looked like things were going to cool down quickly so I made my getaway. 30 minutes into my descent I saw this looking back. Note that weird looking two-fingered column.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS15CloudsAtTop1.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>Every peak clear on up to Mt Adams was growing its own cloud column. The recent rumblings of Mt St Helens was in the news now so I amused myself with thoughts of all the volcanoes firing off in unison.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS16MtJeffClouds.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>Here's a cloud that looked distinctly like a steam eruption:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS17CloudsAtTop2.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=400></P>
<P>And now the clouds were starting to turn dark. I thought a hasty retreat would be smart. That is, if 6 miles can be done hastily.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS18CloudsAtTop3.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>Finally I made it to the flats again. There was occasional thunder but it was confined to the peaks. The cloud shadow line followed me all the way back to my car.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS19JohnAtBottom.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=400></P>
<P>My last view before my woodsy stroll to my car.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="HikePics/MS20Exit.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></P>
<P>By the time I had gotten to this point, I hadn't seen anyone all day except for the small plane that flew overhead and two backpackers. I got back to my car with the sorest feet I can remember by 5:15 pm. It was a long day.</P></BODY>
