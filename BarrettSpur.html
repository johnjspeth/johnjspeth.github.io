<p><b>Barrett Spur, Mt Hood – July 24, 2005</b></p>

<p>Barrett Spur on Mt Hood’s north side is a typical mountain buttress that
seems to have been disconnected from the mountain structure by a glacier that
eroded away the ridge spine.  My Barrett Spur visit was a scouting expedition
for a spring time visit with skis.  The area looks like a go for safety and
access!</p>

<p>Here’s the view of the top of Barrett Spur, my destination.  It’s that
pointy knob to the left of Mt Hood’s north face.</p>

<p>Around the above pictured area are numerous pockets of meadows that are
basins of runoff water where wildflowers thrive.  Here are Lupine and
Paintbrush in the morning light.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture of my last shot to the top of Barrett Spur with a nice view
of Mt Hood’s top and the north face glaciers.  You can trace the challenging Sunshine Route to the top of Mt Hood if you follow the glacier that starts at the top and
slants down to the left.  Those glaciers are huge and no picture could do
justice to conveying the size.  Barrett Spur top is at 7000 ft and Mt Hood top
is at 11000 ft.</p>

<p>Here’s a closer picture of the Ladd Glacier, one of several named glaciers
in the area.</p>

<p>From the peak of Barrett Spur, this picture is looking down (literally) to
the deposition areas.  That whole area must be in constant movement because all
the rocks were clean and sharp and very moveable.</p>

<p>Here’s a nice little rest spot I found on the way down with lots of gnarled
trees.  That’s Mt Adams (right) and Mt Rainier (left) in the distance.</p>

<p>Here’s the trail leading to my car near the end of the day.</p>
